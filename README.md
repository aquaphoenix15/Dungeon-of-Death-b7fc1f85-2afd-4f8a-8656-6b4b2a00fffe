# Dungeon-of-Death-b7fc1f85-2afd-4f8a-8656-6b4b2a00fffe
Dungeons of Death, a simple grid based game that infinitely generates levels for you to defeat!

## Controls
up, down, left, right and 'r' to reset the level if any bugs occur (such as blue square not generating, stuck in wall, blue square unaccesable, etc.)


## Versions
- .JAR- Runs on any device with Java SE 17+ installed
- .TAR.GZ- For any other java devs looking for a place to start
- .EXE- For people who want to play the game without Java installed (Personally I wouldn't run this or put this up here bc people don't bother wanting to install java, but... Marketing...)
